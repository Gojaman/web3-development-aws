# Web3 Development AWS

This repository contains code and documentation for the Web3 Development Workshop. The goal of this project is to build a decentralized application (dApp) using AWS services integrated with blockchain technology.

## Overview
This project showcases how to build a decentralized application (dApp) with AWS services integrated into a blockchain-based system. It includes deploying smart contracts and utilizing AWS services to manage the backend infrastructure, all while demonstrating the scalability and security offered by cloud integration with blockchain.

## Project Structure

- **smart_contracts/**: This folder contains the Solidity smart contracts that are deployed to Ethereum/another blockchain. These contracts handle the core functionality of the dApp.
- **aws_integration/**: AWS configuration files and Lambda functions are placed here. This includes the integration of AWS services such as API Gateway and Lambda to connect with the blockchain.
- **frontend/**: The frontend code for interacting with the dApp, providing users with a web interface to interact with the smart contracts.
- **docs/**: Diagrams and detailed documentation related to the architecture and design of the system.
