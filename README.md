# Web3 Development Workshop

This repository contains code and documentation for the Web3 Development Workshop. The goal of this project is to build a decentralized application (dApp) using AWS services integrated with blockchain technology.

## Overview

The project demonstrates how to:
- Develop and deploy smart contracts
- Integrate AWS services like API Gateway, Lambda, and Managed Blockchain
- Store and retrieve data using decentralized storage (IPFS, AWS S3)
- Build and deploy a decentralized application (dApp)

## Project Structure

- **smart_contracts/**: Contains smart contract code written in Solidity.
- **aws_integration/**: AWS-related configurations (Lambda, API Gateway).
- **frontend/**: Frontend files for the dApp.
- **docs/**: Additional documentation such as architecture diagrams and setup instructions.
